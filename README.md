# Churn-Prediction_ANN
In this project, Deep Learning was used to predict customer churn. We built an ANN model using the new keras package that achieved 82% predictive accuracy (without tuning)! We used three new machine learning packages to help with preprocessing and measuring performance: recipes, rsample and yardstick. Finally we used lime to explain the Deep Learning model, which traditionally was impossible! We checked the LIME results with a Correlation Analysis, which brought to light other features to investigate. For the IBM Telco dataset, tenure, contract type, internet service type, payment menthod, senior citizen status, and online security status were useful in diagnosing customer churn.
